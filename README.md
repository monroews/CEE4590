Drinking Water Treatment Capstone

Student teams create a design for a drinking water treatment facility that solves a problem and meets
the regulatory requirements for a client. The capstone design projects are provided by Cornell alumni
and may include upgrades or new facilities.

The goal is to develop an approach to design that is generalized and that captures expertise in good algorithms.
