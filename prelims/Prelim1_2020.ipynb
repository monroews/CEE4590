Given that this plant is in the city with no good options for any future expansion there will likely be pressure in the future to reduce the amount of land dedicated to handling the backwash water. The need for this land could be due to a need to add treatment processes or to increase plant capacity.\n","\n","The design flow rate for the LAAWFP is 930 cfs. I wasn't able to find the backwash flow rate, but given that the turbidity coming into this plant is relatively high it is likely that the backwash water flow rate exceeds 5% of the plant flow rate. So you may assume the backwash flow rate is 5% of the design flow rate. State your assumptions and give the source of the design values that you select. The 6 backwash ponds are each approximately 100 yards by 100 yards (measured on google maps).\n","\n","a) Estimate the required plan view area of plate or tube settler sedimentation tanks that could be used to more efficiently process the backwash water.
