Floc/floc blanket/sedimentation systems remove the vast majority of solids,  dissolved organics, and even arsenic from drinking water. By efficiently capturing particles these processes reduce the load on the filters and enable the filters to operate without producing excessive amounts of backwash water. \n","\n","Floc diameter and density determines its terminal sedimentation velocity and the ability of the floc to slide down a plate or tube settler. The density of the floc is determined based on its composition and the size of the core particle that aggregated to form the floc. We will explore this by evaluating 3 very different particles that are all made of similar density core particles.\n","\n","Traditionally flocculation is described as being either charge neutralization or sweep. Both of those terms are either incorrect or misleading in the context of surface water treatment. The properties of the flocs that are produced are a function of what they are made of and that is rather simple to figure out. If there is a small amount of coagulant nanoparticles relative to the amount of inorganic (think clay) particles, then the coagulant nanoparticles attach to the clay and help the clay particles stick together. This is probably what is meant in previous literature and textbooks when water treatment flocculation is described as charge neutralization. We are not able to detect any evidence of charge neutralization when using aluminum coagulants that form nanoparticles because the nanoparticles are bigger than the length scale of electrostatic repulsion. Thus charge neutralization flocculation should instead be called Coagulant Nanoparticle Bridging (CNB). CNB occurs when Coagulant Nanoparticles connect inorganic particles (and pathogens) to make flocs.\n","\n","When the amount of coagulant nanoparticles is large compared with the amount of inorganic particles then the coagulant nanoparticles begin to stick to each other. This self aggregation of the coagulant nanoparticles is probably what was meant in previous literature and textbooks when water treatment flocculation is described as \"sweep\" flocculation. However, \"sweeping\" is not a transport or attachment mechanism and is instead a catch all phrase that was used to describe flocculation that occurs when the charge neutralization theory predicted that postively charged particles would be repulsive and hence wouldn't attach. \n","\n","At high coagulant dosages (and we need to define what \"high\" means using an equation!) the flocculation process is being flooded with flocs that are formed from the coagulant nanoparticles that were added. This is flocculation with Coagulant Nanoparticle Flocs (CNF) and requires much more coagulant than CNB.\n","\n","It isn't yet entirely clear why many water treatment plants flocculate with CNF rather than CNB. There are several possible reasons why CNF may be favored. \n","\n","1) Source waters that contain significant dissolved organic or arsenic require high coagulant nanoparticle concentrations because the dissolved organic molecules coat the coagulant nanoparticles and make them not be sticky. Enough coagulant nanoparticles must be added so that there is excess coagulant nanoparticle surface area so that there are sticky surfaces available for attachment. This is the case at the AguaClara plant at Gracias, Honduras.\n","\n","2) Traditional floc/sed systems don't have floc blankets and thus rely entirely on the flocculator to produce large flocs that can be captured by the sedimentation tank. The rate of production of large flocs increases as the concentration of particles increases. Thus large flocs can be produced more quickly if more particles are added. Since coagulant is being added in any case it is easy to simply add much more coagulant and thus produce many coagulant flocs. The problem with this strategy is that the flocs that are produced have low sedimentation velocities. We will demonstrate this in our analysis below.\n","\n","According to MWH Table 4.7 \"sedimentation is used to remove particles that are greater than 0.5 mm.\" We will assume that someone has measured the diameter of particles leaving sedimentation tanks to come up with this result and that the sedimentation tank had a \"standard\" capture velocity (Note that MWH refers to capture velocity as a critical settling velocity).
